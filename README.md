## Minimum Viable Project (MVP)

This project demonstrates a **decoupled architecture** using two separate applications:  

- **Backend:** [.NET 8 RESTful API](https://github.com/pasindumadushan/MVP-RestfulAPI)  
- **Frontend:** [.NET Blazor Single Page Application](https://github.com/pasindumadushan/MVP-BlazorFrontend)  

Unlike traditional **MVC architectures** where frontend and backend are bundled together, this approach allows **independent development** and deployment of both layers.

### Key Features
- **.NET 8 RESTful API** – Modern, fast, and scalable backend.  
- **Blazor Frontend (SPA)** – Delivers a snappy, app-like user experience.  
- **Entity Framework Core** – Maps classes directly to database tables for seamless data access.  
- **Bootstrap** – Ensures responsive design for mobile and desktop.  
- **Data Validation** – Implemented in both frontend and backend for consistency and security.

This setup provides a **flexible, maintainable, and future-proof** foundation for building modern web applications.
